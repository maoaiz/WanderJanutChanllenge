# Custom fields project

## Summary
This project will allow managers to generate dynamic forms for the different teams on the ground. It is a responsive web platform that stores the forms templates and the data uploaded with those forms.

## Scope
We will have different sections to different user types:

* **Account**: A general section that allows access to the data (forms and the form responses).
* **Admin**: A managers section for creating dynamic forms.
* **Forms**: A section to see the forms assigned to the user and its responses.
